With this app, no need to google coronavirus + your country 20 times per day, since that is all shown in your menu bar.

You can customize data of which country/region is shown and how often it updates.

## Which region is your dearest

Coronavirus ticker is fully customizable.

## Data Source

This app fetches data from [this github repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

I believe this app is an appropriate use of the data. I made this to practice my Swift developing skills, and shared it with the world for free.

## Terms of Use

This app is built and shared for academic purpose only. Please feel free to fork or modify it to make it your own.
